# livesentiment
An R package for Sentiment Analysis of Real Time Twitter Feeds.

Package development still in alpha stage.

This R package provides an interactive user interface based on Shiny for analyzing the polarity of real time twitter feeds.
Pre-loading a twitter oauth (and therefore having a twitter account) is necessary for using this package.
