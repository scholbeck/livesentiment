An R package for Sentiment Analysis of Real Time Twitter Feeds.

Package development still in early alpha stage. 

This R package provides an interactive user interface based on Shiny for analyzing the polarity of real time twitter feeds.
Pre-loading a twitter oauth (and therefore having a twitter account) is necessary prior to being able to use this package.
A tutorial on how to set up the twitter oauth is going to be added soon.

Feel free to use this application and leave comments on how to improve it.
