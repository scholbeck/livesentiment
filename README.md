Sentiment analysis of real time twitter feeds in R.
Package development still in early alpha stage. 

This R package provides an interactive user interface based on Shiny for analyzing the polarity of real time twitter feeds.

Pre-loading a twitter oauth (and therefore having a twitter account) is necessary prior to being able to use this package.
A tutorial on how to set up the twitter oauth is going to be added soon.
Meanwhile, the following link contains an excellent manual on how to load your twitter authentification in R.

Feel free to use this application and leave comments on how to improve it.
