# livesentiment
R package for sentiment analysis of real time twitter feeds.

Package development still in alpha stage.

This R package provides an interactive user interface based on Shiny for analyzing the polarity of real time twitter feeds.
Pre-loading a twitter oauth (and therefore having a twitter account) is necessary for using this package.
